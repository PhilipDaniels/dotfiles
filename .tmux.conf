# Enable true color support. The first line sets the $TERM variable as seen
# inside tmux to 'xterm-256color'. The second line enables true-color for
# the outer terminal to which tmux is attached.
# n.b. This all requires tmux 2.2 or later. Cygwin has 2.3 (at least),
# for other system tmux is easy to install (see README on Github).

# So Vim works. With screen-256color most things work, but some keys such as

# this requires a terminal that really can emulate an xterm-256color.
