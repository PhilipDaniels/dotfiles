==========
make_lispy_event : convert struct input_event into a lisp event
there is stuff about Kana in here as well

termhooks.h: line 266, defn of struct input_event

w32inevt.c: there is interesting code in here, around line 200,
which checks and sets modifier states. The function is key_event.

w32term.c: function w32_read_socket is the one that reads messages
from the Windows message queue and converts them into struct input_events.
At line 5318 calls kbd_buffer_store_event_hold which is a macro
in keyboard.h at line 470 which then calls
  kbd_buffer_store_buffered_event in keyboard.c

The *event is expected to have a hyper or super modifier by then.
