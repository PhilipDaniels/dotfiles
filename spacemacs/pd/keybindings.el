;;; This file contains general key bindings. It is the last file loaded. The
;;; word general here means independent of any package. Since the end user can
;;; exclude an arbitrary set of packages, you cannot be sure that, just because
;;; your layer includes a package, that package will necessarily be loaded. For
;;; this reason, code in these files must be generally safe, regardless of which
;;; packages are installed.
