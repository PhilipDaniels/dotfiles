# For bind commands:
#    !  Run the command in the foreground with output shown.
#    @  Run the command in the background with no output. (Can only use if it does not need input).
#    ?  Prompt the user before executing the command.
#    <  Exit Tig after executing the command.

# Reload ~/.tigrc when 'S' is pressed

# Bindings for main mode (log view).
bind main P !?git push                             # Push to remote with confirmation.
bind main <F4> @git difftool -d %(commit)^!        # Compare selected commit to its parent.

# Bindings for status mode. Note that the @ commands will work but you will need to
# refresh the view afterwards.
bind status P !git push
bind status D !@?rm %(file)                        # Make the D key delete a file
bind status r status-revert
bind status s status-update                        # s comes into this mode! Make it do the same as u.
bind status <F4> @git difftool -y -- %(file)       # Run git-difftool on file.
bind status a !git commit --amend -a               # Stage tracked files, amend.
bind status A @git commit --amend -a --no-edit     # Stage tracked files, amend without editing message.
bind status e !git commit --amend                  # Don't stage anything, amend.
bind status E @git commit --amend --no-edit        # Don't stage anything, amend without editing message.
bind status c !git commit                          # Just run commit.

# Bindings for blame mode. Make going backwards and forwards somewhat Vim-like.
# Current bindings:
#   b = back in time to the commit of a line
#   , = back in time to the parent commit of a line
#   < = forwards in time to the view you were at previously

# See https://jonas.github.io/tig/doc/tigrc.5.html search for View manipulation
#bind blame n blame
#bind blame p 
#bind blame l parent       # Same as < keyt
